I notice you haven't provided a specific query, but I can see from the attached information that you're encountering a build error with your TypeScript project. The error message indicates that TypeScript is missing as a dependency, which is needed by tsup to build your project.

Let me help you fix this issue by adding TypeScript as a dev dependency to your project.

I'll edit your `package.json` file to add the TypeScript dependency:

---

_****_

```diff
    },
    "devDependencies": {
-     "tsup": "8.3.5"
+     "tsup": "8.3.5",
+     "typescript": "^5.3.3"
    },
    "scripts": {
```

---

Now that I've added TypeScript as a dev dependency, you'll need to install the dependencies before trying to build again. Let me help you with that:

---

_****_

```bash
pnpm install
```

```
PS C:\dev\git\eliza-adapter-postgres> pnpm install
PS C:\dev\git\eliza-adapter-postgres> pnpm install

Now that TypeScript is installed, let's try building the project again:

I see there's a TypeScript error in your build process. The error message indicates that the identifier `postgresAdapter` cannot be found in `src/index.ts` on line 6. Let me check the contents of that file to help resolve this issue.

Read file: undefined

I see the issue. The file is trying to import `postgresAdapter` from "./client", but then also trying to use it directly. Let me check the client file to see how it's exported.

I see the issue now. The `postgresAdapter` instance is not being exported from the client file. Let me fix this by creating and exporting the adapter instance in the client file.

```diff
  }
  
- export const postgresAdapter: Adapter = {
-     init: (runtime: IAgentRuntime) => {
-         const POSTGRES_URL = runtime.getSetting("POSTGRES_URL");
-         if (POSTGRES_URL) {
-             elizaLogger.info("Initializing PostgreSQL connection...");
-             const db = new PostgresDatabaseAdapter({
-                 connectionString: POSTGRES_URL,
-                 parseInputs: true,
-             });
-     
-             // Test the connection
-             db.init()
-                 .then(() => {
-                     elizaLogger.success(
-                         "Successfully connected to PostgreSQL database"
-                     );
-                 })
-                 .catch((error) => {
-                     elizaLogger.error("Failed to connect to PostgreSQL:", error);
-                 });
-     
-             return db;
-         } else {
-             throw new Error("POSTGRES_URL is not set");
-         }
-     },
- };
+ // Create and export the default adapter instance
+ export const postgresAdapter = new PostgresDatabaseAdapter({
+     host: process.env.POSTGRES_HOST || 'localhost',
+     port: parseInt(process.env.POSTGRES_PORT || '5432'),
+     user: process.env.POSTGRES_USER || 'postgres',
+     password: process.env.POSTGRES_PASSWORD || 'postgres',
+     database: process.env.POSTGRES_DB || 'postgres'
+ });
  
```

I see that there was actually an existing implementation of `postgresAdapter` that I accidentally overwrote. Let me restore the correct implementation:
